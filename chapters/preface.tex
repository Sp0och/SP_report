\chapter{Preface}

Working with robotic systems is both very challenging and rewarding especially when tapping into a new direction. Personally it is a challenge I quite enjoy to tackle however it becomes meaningful only when the underlying goal has the capability of invoking positive change. I believe an autonomous excavator contains such a potential and I feel very fortunate to contribute a small part in its development.
