\chapter{Related Work}\label{ch:related_work}

Certainly the most important related work and the reason this project can even take place is the autonomous excavator heap\citep*{heap} itself. 

Overall the methods chosen in this project are very applied and unconventional which is why there is little related work to be cited. It has to be mentioned however that the entire structure of Unreal Engine multiplayer connections\footnote{Networking in Unreal Engine\\ \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Networking/Overview/}} is a fundamental building block for this project. Especially cross platform multiplayer connections were essential for this work. Secondly the Azure Spatial Anchor\footnote{\url{https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/products/spatial-anchors/}} process is a pipeline that this work relied on.
