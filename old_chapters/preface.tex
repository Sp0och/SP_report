The central aspiration of this work is to embrace the progress of a known technology and to attempt to contribute a small part towards understanding it and using it better in the future. I feel tremendously lucky to be able to work on a topic that seems so meaningful to me in addition to being one of the most interesting I have ever been introduced to. \\

As interesting and fulfilling this field is, it is also very challenging and I would not have been able to achieve the work that I did without the loving support of my family as well as the guidance of my supervisors! For this I would like to thank you!
